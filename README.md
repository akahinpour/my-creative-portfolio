# Creative Portfolio
This portfolio is an attempt to introduce a new way of presenting portfolios: In an interactive video format.
Using an SVG as the top layer of a video, you will experience an interactive introduction to a 4-minute video portfolio.
You can control the video portfolio, by using the mouse wheel and or by clicking on the timeline.
The design and the functionality of the timeline are inspired by Soundcloud's interactive timeline, and you can also skip parts of the video by clicking on the categories at the bottom of the timeline.

I hope you enjoy it and please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Thank you
